# Notes

**For the perfect cheese sauce:**

* Firstly cook the entire sauce right from the beginning on a low flame.

* Make the cheese sauce in a thick bottomed pan, so that the flour or milk does not scorch or burn.

* Use chilled milk or cold milk for making the sauce so that lumps are not formed.

* Be sure to stir the sauce mixture often with a wired whisk or balloon whisk.

* If the sauce becomes too thick, then drizzle some hot milk into it to thin it down.

* When adding shredded cheese, keep the pan on your workplace and not on the stove top or burner.

* Shred your cheese and do not use packaged shredded cheese as they have additional starch on them which can make the sauce gluey or clumpy.
 
**Type of Pasta:** 

* You could use pasta types like shell pasta, farfalle, rotini and even penne in the dish.

**Type of Cheese:**

* The cheese that can be added are cheddar (sharp or white), Monterey jack, gruyere, parmesan, gouda and mozzarella. You can even choose your favorite mix from the above listed cheese.
