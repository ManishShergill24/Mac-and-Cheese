# Mac-and-Cheese
**About this recipe**

* Macaroni and cheese is known as a classic quick meal for kids. However, this is not the powdered cheese version you will find at the store. Instead, this recipe includes a homemade savory sauce that will make this dish popular with the whole family.

* In our home this macaroni and cheese meal is up there with other popular American recipes, such as hash browns, pancakes, veggie burgers, baked beans, apple pie, and eggless waffles.

* Making homemade mac and cheese is actually quite easy once you know how to prepare the perfect cheese sauce. Making the sauce is not difficult, but you do need to keep a few tips in mind to get a creamy, cheesy and smooth sauce.

**Baking Mac and Cheese** 

* Baking macaroni and cheese is optional. I always bake my mac and cheese further as it tastes so good. But if you donâ€™t have an oven or the time, then just mix and serve.

* Do top with breadcrumbs when baking as they add a lovely crispy and crunchy layer.

* Feel free to add seasonings, herbs and spices of your choice. I keep it simple with crushed black pepper and a bit of ground nutmeg. 

* To add some fiber and extra nutrition to in the dish, simply mix in some steamed veggies.
